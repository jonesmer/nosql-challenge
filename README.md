### an exercise using noSQL

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks and a Resources folder.

The first Jupyter notebook, [NoSQL_setup_mj](https://github.com/jonesmer/nosql-challenge/blob/main/NoSQL_setup_mj.ipynb), imports the data from [establishments.json](https://github.com/jonesmer/nosql-challenge/blob/main/Resources/establishments.json), which is in the Resources folder. The data is saved in a Mongo database. The rest of this notebook cleans the database for further analysis (cleanup includes adding a document, removing documents, and changing data types for some fields). The second notebook, [NoSQL_analysis_mj](https://github.com/jonesmer/nosql-challenge/blob/main/NoSQL_analysis_mj.ipynb), uses the cleaned data for analysis.

All code was written by me.
